        <ul>
          <li>The chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken</li>
          <li>Someone is sitting in the shade today because somebody planted a tree a long time ago</li>
          <li>Study not only what to do, but what not to do</li>
          <li>Never ask a barber if you need a haircut</li>
          <li>What you don't do is just as important as what you do</li>
          <li>Questions compel us to think, Answers tell us whether to act</li>
          <li>Price is what you pay, Value is what you get</li>
          <li>It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it, If you think about that, you'll do things differently</li>
          <li>The best thing I did was to choose the right heroes</li>
